                    <p>The founder of the worship centre community MITT PAUL was born in 1939, in Congo. <br>
                        In 1979 he moved to England where he met his lovely wife, got married, and they had 5 children together. <br>
                        Although MITT PAUL had a scientist career as a University Lecturer, he lived a life of Christian believes 
                        and demonstrated a great sense of faith throughout his day-to-day activities. <br>
                        He was gifted with some spiritual power that would influence his life in such a way 
                        that to give up his professional career and dedicated himself in helping people to connect with GOD. <br>
                        He died peacefully in 1995 with natural causes, after a great life of service and devotion within his community. <br>
                        As he could heal ill people with his prayers, those who had the opportunity to meet him claimed that
                         they witnessed manifestations of the true power of GOD through him.

                        <p>The worship centre community was founded in 1980, in Sheffield by a spiritual leader named “Mitt Paul “. <br>
                            The community started as a therapist centre in a small, rented room within a Parish of the church of England assisting those who were suffering of illnesses with root cause deemed as spiritual.
                        <br> After many successes in curing most of illnesses with Payers barely, people came massively with donations to fund the first building acquisition of the community in Sheffield town centre. 
                             The community equipped the building so as to house activities that allow people to grow faith and religion believes. 
                           <br> Since then the community has grew up and extended its activities to other cities of England.
